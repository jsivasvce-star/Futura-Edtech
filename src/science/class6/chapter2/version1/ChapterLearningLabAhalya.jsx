      explanation: '• During the nature walk described in the textbook, the students were accompanied by their science teacher, Dr. Raghu.\n• They were also accompanied by the school gardener, Maniram chacha.\n• Maniram chacha helped guide the students by mimicking various bird calls and showing them the plant life.'

        'Herbs',
        'Shrubs'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: '• Shrubs are medium-sized woody plants that typically branch out near the soil level.\n• Their stems are hard but relatively thin compared to the trunks of large trees.\n• Common textbook examples of shrubs include Rose, Hibiscus, and Lemon plants.'

      correct: 1,
      explanation: '• Watermelon plants have very weak, soft green stems that cannot support the weight of the plant or its heavy fruit upright.\n• As a result, they spread horizontally across the ground and are classified as Creepers.\n• Unlike Climbers, they do not wrap around supports to climb upward.'

      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: '• Reticulate venation features a net-like vein structure branching on both sides of a central midrib.\n• In nature, plants with reticulate venation are strongly correlated with the Taproot system.\n• A Taproot system consists of one thick main root growing deep vertically, with smaller side branches.'

        'Parallel Venation and Taproots'
      ],
      correct: 0,
      explanation: '• Grass is a monocot plant with long, narrow leaves whose veins run parallel from base to tip (Parallel Venation).\n• Grass roots form a dense cluster of thin, equal-sized roots arising from the base of the stem (Fibrous Roots).\n• This venation-root correlation is a universal rule for grass and related monocot species.'

        'Three'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: '• Chickpea seeds can easily be split apart into two equal halves, which are the seed leaves or cotyledons.\n• Plants with two cotyledons are called dicotyledonous or Dicots.\n• Dicots typically have reticulate leaf venation and taproots.'

      explanation: '• Monocotyledonous plants (Monocots) possess exactly one cotyledon in their seeds.\n• This cotyledon count is universally correlated with parallel leaf venation and fibrous root systems.\n• Examples include wheat, maize, rice, and grass.'

        'Muscular legs',
        'Fins and streamlined tail'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: '• Fish have a streamlined body shape that reduces friction and drag while moving through water.\n• Their flat fins provide stability, balance, and steer direction.\n• The powerful muscular tail drives locomotion, pushing the fish forward.'

      q: 'Pigeons can move by:',

      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: '• Pigeons possess forelimbs modified into wings covered with feathers, which allow them to fly efficiently.\n• They also have strong hind limbs (legs) with claws that enable them to walk, run, and perch on branches.\n• This dual mode of locomotion helps them feed and escape predators.'

        'It has gills to breathe underwater.'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: '• Camels native to the cold deserts of Ladakh (Bactrian camels) have two humps instead of one.\n• They grow a very thick, shaggy coat of hair to insulate themselves against the sub-zero temperatures of high altitudes.\n• This adaptation protects them during harsh winters.'
    },
