      explanation: '• Reticulate venation features a net-like vein structure branching on both sides of a central midrib.\n• In nature, plants with reticulate venation are strongly correlated with the Taproot system.\n• A Taproot system consists of one thick main root growing deep vertically, with smaller side branches.'

      explanation: '• Grass is a monocot plant with long, narrow leaves whose veins run parallel from base to tip (Parallel Venation).\n• Grass roots form a dense cluster of thin, equal-sized roots arising from the base of the stem (Fibrous Roots).\n• This venation-root correlation is a universal rule for grass and related monocot species.'

        'Fins and streamlined tail'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: '• Fish have a streamlined body shape that reduces friction and drag while moving through water.\n• Their flat fins provide stability, balance, and steer direction.\n• The powerful muscular tail drives locomotion, pushing the fish forward.'

      explanation: '• Pigeons possess forelimbs modified into wings covered with feathers, which allow them to fly efficiently.\n• They also have strong hind limbs (legs) with claws that enable them to walk, run, and perch on branches.\n• This dual mode of locomotion helps them feed and escape predators.'

        'It has gills to breathe underwater.'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: '• Camels native to the cold deserts of Ladakh (Bactrian camels) have two humps instead of one.\n• They grow a very thick, shaggy coat of hair to insulate themselves against the sub-zero temperatures of high altitudes.\n• This adaptation protects them during harsh winters.'
